# Ankhbot Rank Change Announcer
A Python script for use in [Ankhbot's](http://www.ankhbot.com/) built-in scripting feature which announces in chat when a user changes ranks.
You can check out the functionality on [Github](https://github.com/HyperNeon/ankhbot-rank-change-announcer)

This script will monitor all Twitch users currently connected to chat and make an announcement in Twitch chat whenever a user ranks up or ranks down. The script allows you to customize:
* The message sent when a user ranks up
* The message sent when a user ranks down
* How often the script should run
* Whether to enable the rank up messages
* Whether to enable the rank down messages
* Whether to send alerts for lurkers or only active chatters

### Installation
This script is meant to be run from within the Scripts module in [Ankhbot Twitch Bot](http://www.ankhbot.com/).
Instructions for installing a new script in the bot can be found here: [Offical Ankhbot Documention](http://www.ankhbot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Documentation.pdf).
Everything else you need for configuring the bot can be found within the tooltips that appear when hovering over each configuration parameter in the UI.
